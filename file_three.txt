This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses
had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people
considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also
because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell
what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is
a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying
things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours’ respect, but he
gained—well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.
