Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit—of
Bilbo Baggins, that is—was the fabulous Belladonna Took, one of the three
remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The
Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in
other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy
wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not
entirely hobbit-like about them, and once in a while members of the Took-clan would
go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up;
but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses,
though they were undoubtedly richer. Not that Belladonna Took ever had any
adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo’s father,
built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that was
to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there
they remained to the end of their days.
